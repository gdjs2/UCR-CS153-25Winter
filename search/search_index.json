The laboratory section would be hosted by me, Zhaoqi Xiao. There will be 3 lab assignments for this course starting from lab 1. You need to submit a short report on eLearn and a git commit on github classroom. Late Policy No slack days We will use the eLearn submission timestamp to determine the days. Please note that deadlines are end of day (11:59:59pm). If you're a few minutes late, the submission will not be considered as late. 10% penalty for every late day and the maximum penalty is 50%, so submitting is always better than not submitting. Lab Participation There will be 2 lab session per week, while you only need to take one which is more convenient to you. We will track the attendance in the first lab session after a new assignment is released (e.g., the lab in the next week, in which we will release lab 1). The left Q/A labs will not have attendance taken. You are free to come if you need help on your lab assignment.

C & C++ is memory unsafe (if you don't use smart pointer or 3rd party library to manage the memory usage) as we all know. One critical reason is that, C & C++ can use pointers to manage the memory, which makes it more flexible for low-level programming and more efficient. For some historic reason, most modern OS is mostly written in C, including our xv6. Therefore, understanding C is very important for your programming in xv6. Luckily, C is quite similar to C++ and Java, which most of you have learned. For example, the variable declaration and primary operations. Therefore, I only introduce some key differences for C here. I cannot cover all things in this page. Therefore, if you have more questions, ask me or visit https://cplusplus.com for help. Structure If you have used structure struct in C++, that's good. If not, don't worry. It's just a simple version of class as you have learned in C++/Java. A structure is just a composition of different variables. For example, if you want to declare a data structure, which contains 3 integers and 1 float. struct ds { int a, b, c; float d; } Good? Traditionally, you can't declare a member function inside a structure (just like the way you do in class). Maybe some compilers support this, remember, this is not standard! Therefore, when you need to declare some data structures, use struct and no functions in it. Pointers Pointer type exists in both C & C++. Simply, it's a value, which stores an \"address\" of something. What is address? Assume you have a variable, like a . int a = 0xdeadbeef; This a should be stored in some place in the memory. We use \"address\" to find this place in the memory.","title":"Introduction to C language and Pointers"},{"location":"lab-instructions/c-pointers/#introduction-to-c-language-and-pointers","text":"","title":"Introduction to C language and Pointers"},{"location":"lab-instructions/c-pointers/#c-language","text":"C is a little different from the high-level languages you have learned like C++, Python, Java etc., (even though C++ is derived from C in some sense).

This is a demo for you to get familiar to the github classroom. Try this step-by-step demo and push your work to see whether you can achieve full score!

Any Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) 2. macOS 3. Windows Subsystem Linux, WSL (Click here to see how to install!) Required Tools After you get your system set up, you should install some necessary tools for developing xv6. Run the following command in your command line (copy & paste the command just following the $ sign). If you meet errors when downloading the requirements, check whether you update your package manager's index first. For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you need use $ sudo apt update to update your index. Debian or Ubuntu $ sudo apt-get install git build-essential gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu Arch Linux $ sudo pacman -S riscv64-linux-gnu-binutils riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb qemu-emulators-full macOS Install developer tools if you haven't: $ xcode-select --install Next, install Homebrew , a package manager for macOS if you haven't: $ /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" Next, install the RISC-V compiler toolchain : $ brew tap riscv/riscv $ brew install riscv-tools The brew formula may not link into /usr/local. You will need to update your shell's rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc ) to add the appropriate directory to $PATH . Finally install QEMU: $ brew install qemu Test your tools Run the following command to see whether it can give you the version number for the programs: $ qemu-system-riscv64 --version QEMU emulator version 8.2.2 (Debian 1:8.2.2+ds-0ubuntu1.2) ...

To quit qemu type Ctrl-a x (press Ctrl and a at the same time, followed by x ) Add the First User Program! Open this directory using any code editor (e.g., vscode). In the directory /user , add a file named by hello-world.c . Copy and paste the following code to the file. Remember to save it. #include \"kernel/types.h\" #include \"user/user.h\" int main() { printf(\"hello, world\\n\"); } Add one line in the file /Makefile , just after line 141 and save. ... $U/_grind\\ $U/_wc\\ $U/_zombie\\ $U/_hello-world\\ Now recompile the code using make qemu . After you see init: starting sh . You can type ls to check whether there is a new program naming hello-world . If there is, type command hello-world to run this program. $ hello-world hello, world You are done with your work here! Push Your Work You now can push your work to the repository in Github Classroom. You can use the GUI of your editor (e.g., vscode) to do this, or you can use the command line. For command line: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line For vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_staging-and-committing-code-changes Just focus on Section Staging and committing code changes and Section Pushing and pulling remote changes Hit: Always use make clean to clean up the binary files compiled before you commit your change. It can avoid submitting unnecessary files (usually binary and intermediate files). Basic Linux Commands cd [SOMEWHERE] : change directory to SOMEWHERE. cd / will change directory to root directoty. cd .. will change to the upper level directory. cd dir1 will change to dir1 under currect directory. ls or ls [SOMEWHERE] : ls is the same as ls . , which means list the items in currect directory. You can use a parameter to specify which directory you want to list. Basic Git Commands git clone [URL] : clone a repository to currect position. git add [FILES] : add some files for tracking. git commit -c \"CMNT HERE\" : commit the changes and append some comment. git push : push the commit(s) to the remote repository.
