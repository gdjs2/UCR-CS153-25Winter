# CS153 - Design of Operating System - Lab Session - 25 Winter

## Basic Info

HiðŸ‘‹, welcome to the course page for *CS153 Design of Operating System, Winter 2025* for UC Riverside, whose lecture is hosted by Prof. [Heng Yin](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/). The laboratory section would be hosted by me, Zhaoqi Xiao. 

There will be 3 **individual** lab assignments for this course starting from lab 1. You need to submit a short report on eLearn and a git commit on github classroom. 

## Late Policy

* No slack days
* We will use the eLearn submission timestamp to determine the days. Please note that deadlines are end of day (11:59:59pm). If you're a few minutes late, the submission will not be considered as late.
* 10% penalty for every late day and the maximum penalty is 50%, so submitting is always better than not submitting.

## Lab Participation

There will be 2 lab sessions per week, while you only need to take one which is more convenient to you. We will track the attendance in the first lab session after a new assignment is released (e.g., the lab in the next week, in which we will release lab 1). 

The left Q/A labs will not have attendance taken. You are free to come if you need help on your lab assignment.
